My name is Josh. I work on all things scientific/technical computing, but my niche is the intersection of statistics and computer science. I'm good at solving problems and then converting whiteboard math into efficient programs. [Julia](https://julialang.org) is [my favorite language](/posts/2018-08-17-why-i-use-julia.qmd). During my PhD I researched online (a.k.a. streaming or single-pass) algorithms for statistics (see [OnlineStats.jl](https://github.com/joshday/OnlineStats.jl)).  I spent 8 years at [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com) working primarily on large government-funded projects (Air Force, DARPA, In-Q-Tel, etc.).  In November 2025 I became the Director of Software Engineering at [Rallypoint One](https://rallypoint1.com) where I am the PI for a variety of (mostly) federally funded programs (Navy SBIR, NSF).
