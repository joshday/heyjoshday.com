# About Me

My name is Josh.  I work on all things "technical computing", but my niche is the intersection of statistics and computer science.  I'm good at solving problems and then converting whiteboard math into efficient programs.  [Julia](https://julialang.org) is [my favoriate language](blog/2018-08-17-why-i-use-julia/).  During my PhD I researched online (a.k.a. streaming/single-pass) algorithms for statistics (see [**OnlineStats.jl**](https://github.com/joshday/OnlineStats.jl)).


# Things I've Built

#### Products

- [**One Click Tuner**](https://oneclicktuner.com): Chromatic musical instrument tuner for iOS.
- [**TrendSpot**](https://trendspot.io): Keyword research tool.

#### Open Source

- [**OnlineStats**](https://github.com/joshday/OnlineStats.jl): Single-pass algorithms for statistics.
- [**AverageShiftedHistograms**](https://github.com/joshday/AverageShiftedHistograms.jl): Kernel density estimation for big data.
- [**SparseRegression**](https://github.com/joshday/SparseRegression.jl): Penalized (Ridge, LASSO, etc.) regression and classification models.
- Many more projects on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/joshday?tab=repositories).

#### Closed Source

- Web API for NLP (Natural language processing).
- Web app and backend for time series analysis based on news article NLP (sentiment, entities) of various sources.
- Full stack development of web app for analyzing test flight data.
