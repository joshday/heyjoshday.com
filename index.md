# Bio

I am a PhD statistician who enjoys programming (particularly with Julia) for **difficult optimization and machine learning problems**.  My niche is the intersection of statistics and computer science, which allows me to quickly translate whiteboard math into efficient programs.  During my PhD years I researched **on-line algorithms for statistics** (single-pass algorithms for streaming and big data), an underused paradigm where statistics/models can be updated on new batches of data without revisiting past observations (see [**OnlineStats.jl**](https://github.com/joshday/OnlineStats.jl)).  I am a [research scientist](https://www.seqstat.com/post/mm-algorithms/), [data scientist](https://www.seqstat.com/post/glmnet-tutorial/), [machine learning engineer](https://www.seqstat.com/post/juliaml/), and [software engineer](https://www.seqstat.com/post/whyjulia/). I contribute to a variety of open source data science tools, some of which can be found here: [https://github.com/joshday](https://github.com/joshday).
