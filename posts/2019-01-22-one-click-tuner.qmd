This is a bit off topic for me, but I recently created an [iOS Tuner App](https://www.seqstat.com/tuner/) after not being satisfied with the other tuner apps out there (I play guitar).  It was an excuse to learn some swift/signal processing as well as design a new kind of tuner display that I think is a bit more insightful than the norm:

I've written a few more details about it at [the app's website](https://oneclicktuner.com).
