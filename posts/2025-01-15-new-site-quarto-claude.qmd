I recently rebuilt my personal website using [Quarto](https://quarto.org), mostly via [Claude Code](https://claude.ai). The previous version was built with [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl), a (really cool) static site generator written in Julia.  I'm still kicking the tires on AI-centric development workflows and this was a good exercise.

Quarto covers so many use cases I've decided to invest in it as a medium.  This way, when I'm generating a report/website/etc., I'll have some knowledge about the format.
